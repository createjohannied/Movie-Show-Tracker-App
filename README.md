## What I Learned

I learned how to build a full-stack app that connects a website to a database. I also  used AI tools like Cursor AI and Copilot to help me build this project. 
At first, I was terrifed in creating a full-stack app but with video and AI it because almost second nature the second time around.
I now understand React, Express, Node, PostgreSQL, and something I've been meaning to learn since forever which was GitHub and APIs and they definitely feel less scary now. Also deploying to a cloud is something I heard about but doing it yourself
is very rewarding.
